PDF Merger
==========

This application was created because I needed a program to merge my cover letter and my resume into one package, 
so that it can be uploaded unto Jobmine. However, I did not want to use the online services as I did not want my personal information to be uploaded to random servers.

Basically, it is a program which merges two PDF files together.
Basic functionality works:
* Merge two PDF files together.
* Has a progress bar which tells users of completion.
  
More features to come!
* Choose which pages to merge.
* Dynamically change order of pages.
* Merge more than two files.
