PDF MERGER
==========
This application was created because I needed a program to merge my cover letter and my resume into one package, 
so that it can be uploaded unto Jobmine. However, I did not want to use the online services as I did not want my personal information to be uploaded to random servers.

--DISCLAIMER-- By NO MEANS is this program to be used by others. It was created solely for my personal use; therefore, licensing might not be completely reflective of the third party libraries used.

Latest version is **1.0.1**.

Basically, it is a program which merges multiple PDF files together.
Basic functionality works:
* Merge multiple PDF files together.
* Drag-and-drop capability
* Has a progress bar which tells users of completion.
  
More features to come!
* Choose which pages to merge.
* Dynamically change order of pages.

**Change Log**

To build the application and run it on your machine, you can either download the [JavaFXApp](https://www.dropbox.com/s/hx67sujlbsirhq0/JavaFXApp.zip?dl=0) or build it using intelliJ.

There is a minor problem where chrome automatically blocks the file upon downloading, this is a false positive.
